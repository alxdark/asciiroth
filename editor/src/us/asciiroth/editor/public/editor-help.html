<p>The <a href="http://icculus.org/asciiroth/map-guide.html"
target="_blank">Guide to Creating Asciiroth Maps</a> provides extensive
details on how to create the piece strings you must create in the editor.
This document describes the editor itself, and the options available in the
upper-right hand corner of the editor.</p>

<h3>Main Areas of the Editor</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Brush Options</dt>
    <dd>This area tells you the X/Y location of the cursor over the map, and
      provides a place to change the size of your "brush" to paint larger
      areas of the board.</dd>
  <dt>Piece Library</dt>
    <dd>This is a complete list of the piece types (terrain, agents and
      items) that are available for making maps. When you select one of these
      types, it will be added to the instance editor underneath the board.
      Except for simple pieces, this new piece instance isn't going to have
      enough information to be a valid piece on the board.</dd>
  <dt>Instance Editor</dt>
    <dd>The area under the board lists all the specific game piece instances
      that are available or being used on the board. Typically you must fill
      out a newly added "piece key" to complete it: you must specify its
      color, orientation, on/off state and the like. When the piece key is
      valid, the little red ball <img alt="Invalid Piece"
      src="icons/bullet_delete.png"> will turn into a little green ball <img
      alt="Invalid Piece" src="icons/bullet_green.png">. You can then select
      that piece and "paint" one or more squares on the board with it.</dd>
  <dt>Board Area</dt>
    <dd>The main area is the board. You basically paint the cells until you
      have the map you desire. One thing to note is that if you shift-click
      on a cell, you'll get an editor for that cell that can be used to
      remove a specific piece there, or to set the player's start location at
      that cell (more is coming).</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Editor Toolbar</h3>

<p>There are nine buttons on the editor's toolbar.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><img alt="" src="icons/arrow_out.png"> Adjacent Board Navigation</dt>
    <dd>Opens a panel that allows you to quickly load an adjacent board
      (including boards above and below the current board). This is a little
      easier than using "Open Board" to navigate back and form between
      boards. </dd>
  <dt><img alt="" src="icons/table_edit.png"> Board Metadata Editor</dt>
    <dd>Opens an editor for the board's metadata (inside/outside, adjacent
      maps, etc).</dd>
  <dt><img alt="" src="icons/add.png"> New Board</dt>
    <dd>Starts a new board. Will prompt you to save an existing board first.
    </dd>
  <dt><img alt="" src="icons/folder.png"> Open Board</dt>
    <dd>Open an existing board (opens file dialog). </dd>
  <dt><img alt="" src="icons/disk.png"> Save Board</dt>
    <dd>Save board (will prompt for file name if not previously saved). </dd>
  <dt><img alt="" src="icons/disk_multiple.png"> Save Board As</dt>
    <dd>Save current board under a new name. </dd>
  <dt><img alt="" src="icons/control_play_blue.png"> Preview Board (Test
  Play)</dt>
    <dd>Save and then open this board so you can play test it. In order for
      this to work, you must set a startX and startY value in the board's
      metadata. This is just a start position for the player, it will have no
      effect on the game <em>unless</em> this board is the entrance board for
      the scenario, in which case this is where the player will be started.
      Similarly, you can equip the player with a start inventory, and for
      test purposes, the player will be created with those items (this is
      helpful whenever you are trying to test a puzzle that requires items
      from another board). </dd>
  <dt><img alt="" src="icons/style_add.png"> Create Board Name</dt>
    <dd>This simply makes up a word that you can use as the name of a
      board... it's tedious to make up board names. </dd>
  <dt><img alt="" src="icons/help.png"> Help</dt>
    <dd>Opens the help dialog. </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Cell Editing</h3>

<p>In order to inspect the exact
contents of a cell, <b>shift-click on the cell</b> to bring up a cell editor. The
editor will allow you add and remove multiple items from the cell, start the
player on that cell, or select any piece on the cell as the selected piece for 
your brush. </p>

<h3>Using the Mouse</h3>

<p>Right-clicking on a cell will select the terrain on that cell as the terrain to 
use when painting. </p>
