<p>The Tombs of Asciiroth is a free, open source game you can play right now
in your browser. It has arcade, puzzle and exploration-style game play in an
extensive world of font-based abstraction. </p>

<p>If it looks a little old school, it's only because I've been trying to
make this game since 1980. But other things kept getting in the way. Hope you
have some fun with it. </p>

<p>Play Asciiroth one of two ways: </p>

<p><b class="news">News:</b> A lot has changed since I first wrote this game in 2008(?) I've 
recompiled against newer versions of GWT and Adobe AIR so everything should run and be up-to-date, 
and replaced Google Gears with the standard APIs for saving data in newer browsers. </p>

<p>I'm not going to work on this game anymore because GWT is a legacy technology that has been 
superceded by faster JavaScript engines and vastly better JavaScript programming tools. But 
the editor still works and provides a huge number of game pieces, relative even to what is 
used in the scenarios included with the current game. So I may do some more level design at 
some point. </p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has written in with comments, bug reports, and suggestions! It makes 
it all worthwhile to hear someone finished the game. </p>

<p>Asciiroth has a map editor that can be used to create maps. Read the
<a href="map-guide.html">Guide to Creating Asciiroth Maps</a> for details, 
and the <a href="api/index.html">API documentation</a> for a description of 
all the available pieces and how they work. I'm also happy to answer questions
and/or fix the code if it's needed to create scenarios. </p>

<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>The code has been moved to GitHub, I don't work on this game (or GWT) anymore. There are 
better ways to do something like this now. However by and large, all the instructions below are 
accurate if you want to tinker:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://github.org/alxdark/asciiroth/">Source</a></li>
    <li><a href="defects.html">Defects</a></li>
    <li><a href="build.html">Build Instructions</a></li>
    <li><a href="api/index.html">JavaDocs</a> (API documentation, but also good for looking up pieces)</li>
    <li><a href="testing.html">Cross-Browser Test Status</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The game has been made with the Google Web Toolkit, Eclipse, and Ant. </p>

<h3>Release Notes</h3>

<h4>0.8</h4>

<p>Moved source code, recompiled to recent versions of GWT (2.5) and Adobe AIR (4). </p>

<h4>0.7</h4>

<p>Updated to GWT 1.7. The game will now work in Safari 4 and Adobe AIR 1.5.1. </p>

<p>Support for HTML 5 database persistence. On Safari 4 you no longer need a plugin to save games, it 
will just work. I expect the same to be true of Firefox as well, in some future release. </p>

<p>Tons of new pieces: waterfalls, rafts, bridges, campfires, mushrooms, kiwis, apples, bread, daggers, 
slings, hammers, colored wall pieces, trash heaps, haystacks, pressure plates, crevasses, pylons and 
crystals to open the pylons (most to create a scenario that's a little more RPG, a little less puzzle-oriented). 
Ranged weapons can (optionally) require ammo to use, and you can place ammo in the editor. 
Chests/crates can hold multiple items. </p>

<p>This is getting to a pre-release state. What holds me off from designating 1.0 is that I will take 
a final pass for bugs due to all the new pieces, and I would like one more good scenario in the final
release (having cut my teeth on the TOA scenario, I feel I can do better, and only a small fraction 
of the available pieces and capabilities are in that scenario.)

<h4>0.6.3</h4>

<p>Fixed bug where you couldn't finish TOA scenario, a but that users would not find until being literally
one step away from victory. Easily the meanest thing I've ever done as a programmer, if not 
the Hooloovo. </p>

<h4>0.6.2</h4>

<p>Scenario updates/fixes. </p>

<h4>0.6.1</h4>

<p>Updates to the gold castle scenario. </p>

<h4>0.6</h4>

<p>New scenario, usability enhancements to map editor, some bug fixes. </p>

<h4>0.5.2</h4>

<p>Fixed a bug that messed up the ending of the TOA scenario; worked on performance. 
The game now works quite well in IE8 although there are some further steps that can be taken. </p>

<h4>0.5.1</h4>

<p>Save game did not work correctly (SQL was wrong). </p>

<h4>0.5</h4>

<p>You can now save a game under a different name, so you can have more than one save point in a 
game. You can now load a scenario from the new game dialog (AIR only), so they don't have 
to be included directly in the game. Map making instructions are updated to describe how 
to create a functional stand-alone scenario, and the editor allows you to enter the scenario data, 
so that closes the loop on that. Bug fixes to maps and pieces, mostly minor to the game, 
although you can now pick stuff up that lands on low terrain like chests, crates and urns. </p>

<h4>0.4.3</h4>

<p>Addresses focus goofiness, and keyboard shortcuts not working to control the browser. </p>

<h4>0.4.2</h4>

<p>Fixes for a number of reported bugs. Keyboard mapping revised to work on international keyboard layouts. Font symbols revised for better compatability. Mouse-based navigation improved a bit. </p>

<h4>0.4.1</h4>

<p>Fixed a bug that hanged saving when there's something continually flying through the air. </p>

<h4>0.4</h4>

<p>This is a complete release. After this, I'll try and keep things backwards compatible. </p>
<ul>
    <li>The main TOA scenario and a tutorial are done (probably will be tweaked further). </li>
    <li>New game pieces (pushers, sliders), new critters, now organized in groups in the map editor</li>
    <li>Refinements to both the game and map editor UIs</li>
    <li>Performance work (bit flags, compile-time class swapping, etc.). </li>
    <li>Bug fixes, of course. </li>
</ul>

<h4>0.3</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A large number of new pieces have been added, including many more
    agents and some pretty entertaining puzzle pieces like the reflector and
    the force field. </li>
  <li>The "AI" (if you could call it that) has been improved. Agents navigate
    doors and corners now, and use breadcrumb pathfinding to track the
    player. </li>
  <li>The map editor now includes the ability to play a map in preview mode,
    which is extremely helpful when developing maps. See the help doc from
    within the editor. </li>
  <li>A lot of cleanup of the code, and expansion of lifecycle methods.</li>
</ul>

<h4>0.2</h4>

<p>Initial release on icculus.org. </p>

<h4>Planned</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Localization, if anyone wants to translate it (easy to do with GWT) </li>
    <li>Implement WHAT 5 storage provider, so you can save games as this becomes available in browsers (particularly Safari). </li>
    <li>More pieces as really worthwhile ideas come up. (Should look over ZZT for relevant ideas.)</li>
</ul>
