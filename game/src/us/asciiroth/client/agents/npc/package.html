<h1>Non-Player Characters</h1>

<p>In the context of this game, NPCs are agents with particular kind of
combat behavior and the ability to initiate and finish "quests" in the game.
They can also just talk to the player. They are grouped into races with what
amounts to simplistic profession-based differences. When presenting quests,
they're easily the most complicated piece in the game to create via a map.</p>

<p><strong>Combat.</strong> NPCs can be peaceful or hostile (off or on). When
a peaceful NPC is attacked on the board, all other NPCs of the same race on
the board will become hostile and start attacking the player. (NPCs can also
be created initially as hostiles.) </p>

<p><strong>Conversation.</strong> However, if the player touches a peaceful
NPC without wielding a weapon, conversation will ensue. NPCs have a talk
<code>message</code> that they will show the player, unless they have
additional quest mechanics. NPCs will not approach the player just to
talk.</p>

<p><strong>Quests.</strong> In terms of winning or losing in Asciiroth,
everything comes down to one or more "fetch/deliver quests" where the player
has to move items around on the boards. Even a quest to slay a monster, for
example, needs to be expressed in terms of items ("bring its head back to
me.") This is because items and boards are the only state in the game. So NPC
support for quests involve setting up the expectation that the player will
deliver something for the NPC or bring something back to the NPC. This just
provides a way to structure the goals of a scenario (the TOA scenario
describes the goals using messages, as the island is devoid of people, so
that's another viable approach). </p>

<p>An NPC can be given a <code>questColor</code>, a <code>doneFlag</code>, a
<code>doneColor</code> and an <code>inQuestMsg</code> to control the
presentation and acceptance of a quest for the character. When these are
provided, the NPC will seek out the player within a small area and fire the
<code>questColor</code> event when contacted. This should be used with pieces
like <code>Messenger</code> and <code>Equipper</code> to present a quest to
the player. If there is a <code>doneColor</code> for this NPC, it will also
change color at this point to indicate that it is waiting to hear back on a
quest. (You don't have to do this; the NPC can fire a color event but not
expect to hear back from the player.)</p>

<p>After that, the NPC will give the <code>inQuestMsg</code> message until
the player contacts the NPC with the right flag (basically the right item
although it also tests the flags that are visible to the player). The NPC
will then fire the <code>doneColor</code>, which again should be hooked up to
pieces like <code>Unequipper</code> and <code>Messenger</code> to close out
the quest. After that, like non-quest NPCs, the NPC will present the normal
<code>message</code>. Note that for NPCs who present quests, the first time
they present <code>message</code> is after the quest has been completed, so
in this case the message can be tailored accordingly.</p>

<p>Attacking an NPC means you can no longer talk to the NPC, which eliminates
any hope of pursuing a quest through that NPC!</p>

<p><strong>Death.</strong> NPCs can fire a color event when they die. You
could, for example, couple this with a <code>PieceCreator</code> to cause 
the NPC to drop something upon dying (like its head).</p>
