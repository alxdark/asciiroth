<p>You&#x2019;re the <b>@</b> symbol on the map. </p>

<p><b>To move</b> your character, use the arrow keys. In order to move
diagonally, you can use the following keys on the keyboard, or use the number
pad (the number pad doesn't work in Opera): </p>
<pre>y  k  u             7  8  9 
 \ | /               \ | / 
h-- --l             4--5--6
 / | \               / | \
b  j  n             1  2  3

p = pick up item    5  = pick up item</pre>

<p>These keys will be familiar to NetHack players and Vim users. They&#x2019;re 
wierdly efficient when you get used to them.</p>

<p><b>To identify</b> items on the board, mouse over a region of the board to
see a description. It will only tell you about what you can see, however. </p>

<p><b>To pick up an item,</b> enter the square with the item and
you&#x2019;ll see it listed next to your character. Enter the item&#x2019;s
<b>#</b> to pick it up (or pick up the first item using <b>p</b>, or <b>5</b> 
on the number pad). </p>

<p><b>Using items</b> in your inventory is simple. Use <b>A</b> and <b>S</b>
to select an item, then either press <b>ENTER</b> to use it, or walk toward
the thing on the map you&#x2019;d like to use it on. For example, to use a
key, select it, and then move toward a door. </p>

<p>You can walk around with something selected or &#x201c;in hand&#x201d;;
nothing will happen unless it is useful. </p>

<p><b>To fire your selected item</b> (if it shoots), hold down 
<b>SHIFT</b> or <b>CONTROL</b> and the direction you wish to fire 
(only <b>CONTROL</b> works with the number pad).</p>

<p><b>To throw your selected item,</b> press <strong>T</strong>, followed by
the direction you wish to throw the item.</p>

<p><b>To drop an item</b>, press <b>D</b> and you will drop the currently
selected item. Select <b>E</b> to empty your hands (sometimes useful). </p>

<p><b>To push</b> some items on the board, just move into them. </p>

<p><b>To see the game menu</b> use the <b>ESCAPE</b> key, or use the options 
at the bottom of the screen. Use <b>F3</b> to save your game, 
but be careful: saving at the wrong time can be fatal. </p>

<p><strong>Advanced inventory commands</strong></p>

<p>If more than ten items are
on a square, you may need to use the <b>R</b> key to rotate them if you want
to see them all or pick up only a specific item. </p>

<p><b>To reorder your inventory,</b> select an item, then use <strong>C</strong>
or <strong>V</strong> to move it up/down in your inventory list. </p>

<p><b>To select the first weapon in your inventory,</b> use <strong>W</strong>. 
By re-ordering your inventory and using <strong>W</strong>, you can quickly 
equip your weapon of choice.</p>

<p>Asciiroth is all text so you can <strong>make the board larger or
smaller</strong> by adjusting the font size of your browser. In Firefox, for
example, ctrl-+/- will make the game board larger or smaller (caveats: in FF2 
only some sizes look correct, and in FF3, you must select <code>View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom 
Text Only</code> for this to work correctly). </p>

<p><strong>Using the mouse</strong>

<p>You can select items in your inventory using the mouse (the scroll wheel will 
scroll your inventory as well). If you click on the board, your character will 
attempt to move toward that location. If you click on your character, you can pick 
up items underfoot, or move off the board when you're on the edge. </p>
