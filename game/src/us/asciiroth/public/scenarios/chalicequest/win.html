<p>The chalice looks pretty wicked up on the altar (now get down from there
before you hurt yourself).</p>

<p>You're a town hero now, no doubt about it. Everyone can farm their
potatoes and collard greens in peace once again, comfortable in the knowledge
that nothing is going to eat their chickens while they sleep.</p>

<p>With your newly-gained knowledge of the local tombs, which you just
cleared out, you could also run a pretty good tour business, showing
out-of-towners the ancient burial grounds of the kings. If anyone ever came
her from the north, which basically, they don't anymore. But you never
know...</p>

<p>THE END</p>
