<p>"The last king of the Tenkay left the Red and Blue Rings when he 
deserted the island." </p>

<p>"The Blue Ring was left in the plane beyond the lighthouse. The catacombs 
were deemed enough of a deterrant to protect it."</p>

<p>"But the Red Ring, which was rather more dangerous, he left in the 
abandoned temple in the Kreniak Desert. Alber the Wise lived north of 
the temple on a small cattle ranch for many years, ostensibly to keep 
an eye on it." </p>
