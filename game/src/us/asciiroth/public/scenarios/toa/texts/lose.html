<p>Is it sinking in yet? You've saved your life, but none of the items you're carrying clearly prove your journey to the Isles of Asciiroth. Nothing from that great civilization. Nothing that would really advance your career. </p>

<p>It's a semi-sweet end to your travails... we're all hoping you've got a save file at this point, so you can forget this even happened, and resume your search on the isles. </p>

<p>That is, if you've got the stomach to head back and cement your career as the greatest adventurer archaeologist of all time... </p>
